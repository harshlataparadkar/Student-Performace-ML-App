🎓 Student Performance Machine Learning Web App

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application built using Streamlit to predict and analyze student performance.
This project demonstrates practical implementation of regression and classification models with real-time evaluation.

🔍 What This Project Does

Predicts Final Grades (Regression)

Predicts Pass/Fail and Admission Status (Classification)

Allows dynamic selection of:

Target variable

Input features

Machine Learning algorithm

🧠 Machine Learning Implementation

Linear Regression → Final Grade prediction

Classification Models:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

The model is trained on 80% data and tested on 20% data.

📊 Output & Evaluation

Displays Training Accuracy and Testing Accuracy

Enables comparison of multiple ML algorithms

Helps understand model generalization on unseen data
